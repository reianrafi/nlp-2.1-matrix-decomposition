## Introduction

Matrix decomposition plays a vital role in various fields such as statistics, computer science, and engineering. This repository aims to provide a straightforward implementation of key matrix decomposition algorithms. By using these algorithms, you can simplify complex problems and gain insights into data structures.

## Matrix Decomposition Overview

Matrix decomposition involves breaking down a matrix into simpler, constituent matrices. This process can help solve systems of equations, perform dimensionality reduction, and enhance data visualization. The main types of matrix decomposition include:

- **Eigen Decomposition**
- **LU Decomposition**
- **PLU Decomposition**
- **QR Decomposition**
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- **Spectral Decomposition**

Each of these techniques has its own applications and benefits, making them essential for anyone working with matrices.

## Algorithms Included

### Eigen Decomposition

Eigen decomposition decomposes a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This technique is crucial for understanding the properties of matrices, especially in the context of transformations and stability analysis.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Eigenvalues**: Scalars that indicate how much the eigenvectors are stretched or compressed during a transformation.
- **Eigenvectors**: Directions in which the transformation acts.

### LU Decomposition

LU decomposition factors a matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). This method is particularly useful for solving linear equations.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Lower Triangular Matrix (L)**: Contains all zeros above the main diagonal.
- **Upper Triangular Matrix (U)**: Contains all zeros below the main diagonal.

### PLU Decomposition

PLU decomposition extends LU decomposition by adding a permutation matrix (P). This method improves numerical stability and allows for the solution of more complex systems.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Permutation Matrix (P)**: A matrix that rearranges the rows of another matrix.

### QR Decomposition

QR decomposition breaks a matrix into an orthogonal matrix (Q) and an upper triangular matrix (R). This method is often used in solving linear least squares problems.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Orthogonal Matrix (Q)**: A matrix whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors.
- **Upper Triangular Matrix (R)**: Similar to LU decomposition.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD is a powerful technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, revealing its structure. It is widely used in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Singular Values**: Non-negative values that provide insight into the matrix's properties.
- **U and V Matrices**: Orthogonal matrices that correspond to the left and right singular vectors.

### Spectral Decomposition

Spectral decomposition expresses a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This method is particularly useful for symmetric matrices.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Symmetric Matrix**: A matrix that is equal to its transpose.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate how to use the algorithms:

### Eigen Decomposition Example

```python
import numpy as np
from eigen_decomposition import EigenDecomposition

matrix = np.array([[4, -2], [1, 1]])
eigen = EigenDecomposition(matrix)
values, vectors = eigen.compute()
print("Eigenvalues:", values)
print("Eigenvectors:", vectors)
```

### LU Decomposition Example

```python
import numpy as np
from lu_decomposition import LU

matrix = np.array([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [1, 0, 3]])
lu = LU(matrix)
L, U = lu.decompose()
print("Lower Triangular Matrix (L):", L)
print("Upper Triangular Matrix (U):", U)
```

### SVD Example

```python
import numpy as np
from svd import SVD

matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
svd = SVD(matrix)
U, S, V = svd.decompose()
print("U Matrix:", U)
print("Singular Values:", S)
print("V Matrix:", V)
```
